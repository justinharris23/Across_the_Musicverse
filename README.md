## Project Title: Across the Musicverse

## Description

Across the Musicverse is a music site pulling in data using the Deezer API and built on the React framework. 

## How to Get Started

- There will be various ways to find an artist, album, or track
- Search will allow you to search artist, album, or track
- There will image/buttons for Artist, Album, or Track. When clicked this will take you a new page where the Top 10 (or more) streamed Artist, Album, or Track, will be displayed
- Click an Artist will take you to a page where you can view the Artists image, along with their Albums and Tracks. 
- Clicking an Album will take you to the albums page where you can view the list of tracks on that particular album
- (A a stretch goal is to pull in Playlists and also allow tracks to be playable)


## React Components

There will be a minimum of 4 components. Possibly more (see strectch goals).

- App.js
- Artists.jsx
- Albums.jsx
- Tracks.jsx
- Charts.jsx (this allows the top streaming info to be displayed)
- Playlists.jsx (stretch goal)
- Genres.jsx (stretch goal)

## Post-MVP Ideas

- Add Deezer's music player that plays 30 sec clips of each track
- Pull in Related Artists
- Clicking the Randomize button without anything in the search area will return a random artist (or album or track)
