## Project Title: Across the Musicverse

## Description

Across the Musicverse is a music site pulling in data using the Deezer API and built on the React framework. This site will allow you see your favorite artists albums and tracks. See the top tracks, albums, artists from around the globe. In addition, you can hear 30 sec clips of songs. 

## How to Get Started

- Search will allow you to search artist, album, or track
- There will be an area featuring the Top Artist, Top Albums, and Top Tracks from around the world. 
- Click an Artist will take you to a page where you can view the Artists image, along with their Albums and Tracks. 
- Clicking an Album will take you to the albums page where you can view the list of tracks on that particular album
- (A stretch goal is to pull in Playlists and also allow tracks to be playable)


## Technology Used

This site will be built in React using Reach components and routers. Javascript and CSS will also be implemented. There will be a minimum of 4 components. Possibly more (see strectch goals).

- App.js
- Artists.jsx
- Albums.jsx
- Tracks.jsx
- Charts.jsx (this allows the top streaming info to be displayed)
- Playlists.jsx (stretch goal)
- Genres.jsx (stretch goal)

## Post-MVP Ideas

- Add Deezer's music player that plays 30 sec clips of each track
- Pull in Related Artists
- Clicking the Randomize button without anything in the search area will return a random artist (or album or track)
